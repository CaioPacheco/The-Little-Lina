# The Little Lina
The Little Lina is a game that started as a small project for a software development class, but never was finished to the level I'd like. Now I'll go over it again to redo some parts and polish others. This is a low importance project that I plan to do mostly as a hobby, since game development is one of my biggest areas of interest, so it doesn't have estimated time frame nor a guarantee that it will ever be finished.

RPG Maker MV is the game engine. Generic assets are in use at the moment and there is no active plan to change them, however if it becomes a possibility, I will.

In a nutshell, the game is tale about two twins, Lina and Theo, that loose each other in a time bending mansion. You mainly play as Lina, and will go trough challenges and have to understand both time and it's powers to find her brother Theo before it's too late.
